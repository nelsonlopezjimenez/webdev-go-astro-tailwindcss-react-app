Here's a comprehensive comparison between an Electron desktop app and a Go app with embedded frontend for your markdown editing/reading application:

## **Compilation & Deployment**

### **Electron App**
**Advantages:**
- Single `npm run build` command for all platforms
- Automatic cross-compilation (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Well-established build tools (electron-builder, electron-forge)
- Hot reload during development

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex dependency management (native modules can break)
- Platform-specific signing/notarization requirements
- Longer build times due to bundling entire Chromium
- Large node_modules folder during development

### **Go + Embedded Frontend**
**Advantages:**
- Single binary executable with zero dependencies
- Cross-compilation built into Go (`GOOS=windows go build`)
- Extremely fast compilation (seconds vs minutes)
- Simple deployment - just copy the executable

**Disadvantages:**
- Frontend must be pre-built and embedded at compile time
- Slightly more complex build pipeline for frontend assets
- Hot reload requires additional tooling setup

## **Executable Size**

### **Electron App**
- **Size:** 150-300MB typical
- **Why:** Bundles entire Chromium browser + Node.js runtime
- **Distribution:** Large installer files, slow downloads

### **Go + Embedded Frontend**
- **Size:** 10-50MB typical
- **Why:** Go binary + compressed frontend assets only
- **Distribution:** Single small file, fast downloads

```go
// Example Go embedding (Go 1.16+)
//go:embed dist/*
var frontendFiles embed.FS
```

## **Security**

### **Electron App**
**Vulnerabilities:**
- Full Node.js API access from renderer (if not properly sandboxed)
- Chromium security updates required
- Large attack surface
- Context isolation must be properly configured

**Security Model:**
```javascript
// Must properly configure:
contextIsolation: true,
nodeIntegration: false,
preload: './preload.js'
```

### **Go + Embedded Frontend**
**Advantages:**
- No Node.js runtime vulnerabilities
- Smaller attack surface
- Go's memory safety
- Clear separation between backend (Go) and frontend

**Architecture:**
```
Browser ← HTTP/WebSocket → Go Server (localhost:8080)
```

## **Performance & Resource Usage**

### **Electron**
- **RAM:** 100-200MB minimum (Chromium overhead)
- **CPU:** Higher idle usage
- **Startup:** Slower (loading Chromium)

### **Go + Embedded**
- **RAM:** 10-30MB typical
- **CPU:** Very low idle usage
- **Startup:** Nearly instant

## **Development Experience**

### **Electron**
**Pros:**
- Rich ecosystem (electron-builder, auto-updater)
- Native OS integration APIs
- Familiar web development workflow

**Cons:**
- Complex IPC between main/renderer processes
- Version compatibility issues
- Heavy development environment

### **Go + Embedded**
**Pros:**
- Simple architecture
- Go's excellent standard library
- Type safety and excellent tooling
- Clear request/response model

**Cons:**
- Less native OS integration
- Manual implementation of desktop features
- Smaller ecosystem for desktop-specific features

## **Feature Comparison**

| Feature | Electron | Go + Embedded |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| File system access | Native APIs | HTTP endpoints |
| System notifications | Built-in | Manual/limited |
| Auto-updater | Mature solutions | Manual implementation |
| Window management | Full control | Browser-dependent |
| Offline capability | Full | Limited (cached assets) |
| Native menus | Yes | No |
| System tray | Yes | Limited |

## **Recommendation for Your Use Case**

**For a markdown editor/reader, Go + Embedded Frontend is likely better because:**

1. **Simple Requirements:** Markdown editing doesn't need heavy native integration
2. **Better Performance:** Much faster and lighter for text editing
3. **Easier Distribution:** Single small executable
4. **Security:** Simpler security model
5. **Maintenance:** Fewer dependencies to manage

**Go Example Structure:**
```go
func main() {
    // Embed Astro/React build
    //go:embed dist/*
    var assets embed.FS
    
    // API routes
    http.HandleFunc("/api/markdown", handleMarkdown)
    
    // Serve frontend
    http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.FS(assets)))
    
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Choose Electron if you need:**
- Rich native desktop features
- Complex offline functionality  
- Existing Electron ecosystem integrations
- Multiple windows with complex interactions
