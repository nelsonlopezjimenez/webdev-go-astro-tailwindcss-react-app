For your Go server embedding scenario, **static mode is significantly better** than hybrid mode. Here's why:

## Static Mode Advantages

**Simpler Go Integration:**
- Single `dist` folder with flat file structure
- All files are pre-built at compile time
- No server-side rendering complexity in Go
- Straightforward file serving with `embed.FS`

**Better Performance:**
- No runtime compilation or server-side processing
- Files served directly from memory (embedded)
- Faster response times
- Lower memory usage

**Easier Deployment:**
- Single executable binary contains everything
- No need to handle Astro's server runtime
- Simpler error handling and debugging

## Hybrid/Server Mode Drawbacks

**Complex Integration:**
- Requires handling both `dist/client` and `dist/server`
- Need to integrate with Astro's server runtime
- More complex routing logic
- Potential conflicts between Go and Astro routing

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- May require Node.js runtime in production
- Additional memory overhead
- More complex error scenarios

## Your Use Case Analysis

Looking at your application:
- Course management with mostly static content
- Lesson pages that don't change frequently
- API endpoints handled by Go (not Astro)
- Simple routing needs

**Recommendation: Stick with static mode**

Your current setup works well because:
1. Course content is relatively static
2. Go handles dynamic API endpoints
3. Astro generates optimized static pages
4. Simple embed and serve pattern

## When You Might Consider Hybrid

Only consider hybrid if you need:
- Server-side rendering for SEO on specific pages
- Dynamic content that changes per request
- User authentication state in pages
- Real-time data that can't be handled via API calls

For your course management system, static mode with API endpoints is the optimal architecture.
