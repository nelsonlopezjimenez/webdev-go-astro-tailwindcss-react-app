Yes, you can create basic icons in Windows 10 without extra tools, though the options are limited:

## Method 1: Using Paint (Built-in)
1. Open **Paint** (search for it in Start menu)
2. Create a small image (32x32 or 64x64 pixels work best)
3. Use simple shapes, text, or drawings
4. Save as **PNG** or **BMP**
5. When changing the icon (Properties > Change Icon), browse to your image file

## Method 2: Using Paint 3D (Built-in)
1. Open **Paint 3D**
2. Create a simple design using shapes and text
3. Export as PNG with small dimensions
4. Use the same process as above

## Method 3: Extract from Existing System Icons
1. In the Change Icon dialog, browse to:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\shell32.dll` (has many built-in icons)
   - `C:\Windows\System32\imageres.dll` (more modern icons)
   - Other .exe files often contain icons
2. Select from the available icons

## Method 4: Screenshot + Crop
1. Take a screenshot of an emoji or symbol from a website
2. Open in Paint and crop to a small square
3. Save as PNG/BMP

## Limitations:
- No transparency support in Paint (backgrounds will be white)
- Limited to basic shapes and colors
- Not true .ico format (but Windows accepts PNG/BMP for shortcuts)
- Won't look as professional as dedicated icon tools

## Best Built-in Option:
Browse `shell32.dll` and `imageres.dll` - they contain hundreds of professional icons including folders, documents, tools, and various symbols that might work for your course server.

For a course server, you might find suitable education or computer-related icons in these system libraries.
