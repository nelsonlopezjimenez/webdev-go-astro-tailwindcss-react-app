I can help you organize your programming notes, bash history files, and task lists. Here are the practical limits for copying and pasting content:

**File Size Limits:**
- **Single message**: Around 100,000-200,000 characters (roughly 50-100 pages of text)
- **Per file**: Most text files under 1MB should work fine
- **Multiple files**: You can share several files in one message using the document format

**Best Approaches:**

**Option 1: Direct Paste**
Just copy and paste your content directly into the chat.

**Option 2: Document Format**
Use the document upload feature if you have files saved on your system.

**Option 3: Chunked Analysis**
For very large collections, break them into logical chunks:
- All bash history files in one message
- Programming notes by language/topic in separate messages
- To-do lists and task management files together

**What I Can Help Organize:**

**Programming Notes:**
- Categorize by language, framework, or concept
- Identify outdated vs current practices
- Create structured reference documents
- Extract reusable code snippets

**Bash History:**
- Extract useful commands and create a reference
- Identify patterns in your workflow
- Create aliases or scripts for repeated tasks
- Remove sensitive information

**Task Lists:**
- Consolidate duplicate items
- Prioritize and categorize tasks
- Identify completed items to archive
- Create actionable next steps

Start with whichever collection feels most urgent or overwhelming. I can process quite large amounts of text and help create organized, searchable reference materials from your scattered notes.
