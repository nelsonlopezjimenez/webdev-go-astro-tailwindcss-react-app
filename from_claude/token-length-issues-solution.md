## For Starting a New Chat

**Opening message template:**
```
I'm continuing work on a 4-section full-stack web development course. I've already created Section 1 (HTML/CSS fundamentals, weeks 1-12) with detailed lesson plans. I need to create Section 2 (JavaScript, weeks 13-24), Section 3 (MERN backend, weeks 25-36), and Section 4 (React, weeks 37-48).

Each lesson needs:
- YAML frontmatter (title, description, week number)
- Learning objectives
- 5 daily activities with progressive complexity  
- Code examples with detailed comments
- Hands-on exercises building toward section projects
- MDN/W3Schools resource links
- Assignment checklists

The lessons integrate with a Go server that serves markdown files with embedded Astro frontend. Students build projects that connect across sections.

Please create Week 13: JavaScript Introduction and Programming Fundamentals as the first lesson of Section 2.
```

## Key Context to Include

**Course Structure:**
- Section 1 (Weeks 1-12): HTML5, CSS3, web fundamentals
- Section 2 (Weeks 13-24): JavaScript programming and DOM
- Section 3 (Weeks 25-36): Backend development with MERN stack  
- Section 4 (Weeks 37-48): React and advanced frontend

**Technical Setup:**
- Go server with file watcher for dynamic lesson content
- Embedded Astro static frontend
- Markdown lessons with YAML frontmatter
- Students build progressive projects across sections

**Lesson Format Established:**
- Each lesson follows consistent structure
- Code examples have detailed comments
- Links to MDN Web Docs and W3Schools
- Daily activities build complexity throughout week
- Assignments connect to larger project goals

## Strategy for Remaining Sections

**Section 2 (JavaScript) Key Topics:**
- Variables, data types, functions
- DOM manipulation and events
- Asynchronous JavaScript (promises, async/await)
- ES6+ features and modules
- Local storage and APIs
- Interactive web applications

**Section 3 (MERN Backend) Key Topics:**
- Node.js and Express server setup
- MongoDB database design
- REST API development
- Authentication and security
- File uploads and middleware
- Connecting frontend to backend

**Section 4 (React) Key Topics:**
- Component architecture and JSX
- State management and hooks
- Routing and navigation
- Forms and validation
- API integration
- Deployment and optimization

## Efficiency Tips for New Chat

1. **Request 3-4 lessons per message** instead of one at a time
2. **Specify the exact week numbers** you need (e.g., "Create weeks 13, 14, 15, and 16")
3. **Reference the established format** by mentioning it follows the pattern from Section 1
4. **Focus on one section at a time** to maintain coherence

This approach will let you complete all remaining sections efficiently while maintaining the quality and consistency established in our current conversation.
