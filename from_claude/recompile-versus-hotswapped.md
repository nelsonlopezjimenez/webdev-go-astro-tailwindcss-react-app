No, it's not possible to update the embedded frontend without recompiling. Here's why and what your alternatives are:

## Why Frontend Updates Require Recompiling

**Go's embed directive works at compile time:**
- Files are read during the `go build` process
- They become part of the binary's data section
- The embedded filesystem is immutable at runtime

**Technical limitations:**
- `embed.FS` is read-only
- No way to modify embedded files after compilation
- This is by design for security and performance

## Alternative Approaches

**Option 1: Hybrid Architecture (Your Current Setup)**
- Keep static frontend embedded (fast loading, single binary)
- Serve dynamic content via API endpoints
- Frontend fetches content from `/api/lessons/4` at runtime

**Option 2: External Static Files**
- Don't embed frontend files
- Serve from filesystem using `http.Dir`
- Can update without recompiling, but requires separate file distribution

```go
// Instead of embed.FS
http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("./frontend/dist/")))
```

**Option 3: Template-Based Rendering**
- Use Go templates instead of static files
- Templates can be updated without recompiling
- More complex to implement

**Option 4: Hot Reload Development Server**
- Separate development server for frontend
- Production uses embedded files
- Development allows live updates

## Recommendation

Your current approach is actually optimal for production:
- Fast startup (embedded assets)
- Single executable deployment
- Dynamic content via API
- Clear separation of concerns

The requirement to recompile for frontend changes is a reasonable trade-off for the benefits you get. Most web applications work this way - frontend builds are typically deployed as new versions rather than hot-swapped.
