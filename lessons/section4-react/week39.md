## Grading Information

Your grade is based on how successful you are at evidencing that you have mastered the intended learning goals for that specific assessment. If I do find that a particular set of questions in an assignment or exam were unreasonably challenging, unclear, or unfair for any reason I will  provide additional credit as appropriate. Also, I do curve the grade for the exams (midterm and final)

If you ever feel that an assignment or specific question is unfair or confusing please come and speak with me (ideally before it is due or during the assessment, but afterwards is okay also) so that we can address this concern as soon as possible. I am committed to making sure the assessment of your learning is comprehensive, fair, and incorporates best practices from education research on assessment design and inclusive practices. 

You will be graded on how well you achieve the Learning Objectives provided for each unit. You are guaranteed an A- if >90%, a B- if >80% and a C- if >70%.

### Grade Weigths

1. Labs: **30%**
1. Quizzes: **10%**
1. Participation: **10%**
1. Exam 1: **10% or 20%** (whichever exam you score lowest on will become worth only 10%)
1. Final Exam: **20%**
1. Attendance: **10%**
1. Extra Credit: **1%**

Information about Exams: Exams are meant to show yourself and me what youâ€™ve learned and what you still need to learn. For the midterm that you do better on, you will automatically have that midterm be worth more of your grade. This is to help relieve test anxiety associated with the midterm.

### Weekly Journal (optional)

During this course, you will keep a journal of reflections on what you are learning. This will build your skills in engaging with and understanding content and in reflecting on what works best for you as a learner. Each week, you will choose from a list of prompts and respond in your journal. 

### Discussion Posts (Mandatory)

Each week, unless otherwise noted, you will respond to a prompt in a Canvas discussion forum and reply to your classmatesâ€™ posts. These discussion forums are your opportunity to continue the conversations we began in class, to engage with your classmates, and to support each other in learning the course material. 

### Quizzes and Activities

Course quizzes are designed to test your understanding of the course material and to give you practice using the test-preparation strategies introduced in this course. Class activities will help you get to know your classmates and will also prepare you for success with the major assignments.


### Final Reflection (optional)

Your final reflection will be a demonstration of what you learned in this course and how you plan to remember and apply the information and skills you have gained in future situations.
