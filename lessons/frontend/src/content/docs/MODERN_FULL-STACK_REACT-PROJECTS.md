Enhance your proficiency in building scalable and sustainable React projects
Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook
Description
Understanding full-stack development is vital as companies aim to bridge the gap between frontend and backend development. Recent trends show deeper integration between the two, opening numerous possibilities for building real-world web applications, through server-side technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Written by the author of Learning Redux and Learn React Hooks, and CEO of TouchLay, Modern Full-Stack React Projects will guide you through the entire process of advancing from a frontend developer to a full-stack developer. Starting with how to set up robust projects that can be maintained for a long time, you’ll then progress toward developing a backend system and integrating it with the frontend. Throughout the book, you’ll learn how to build, test, and deploy a blog application and a chat application. You’ll also explore MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN) stack, best practices for frontend and backend development, different full-stack architectures, unit and end-to-end testing, and deployment of full-stack web applications. Once you get to grips with the essential concepts, you’ll progress to learn how to use Next.js, an enterprise-grade full-stack web framework for React. By the end, you’ll be well-versed in the MERN stack and all set to create performant and scalable full-stack web applications.
Who is this book for?
This book is for frontend developers, JavaScript engineers, and React developers who possess a solid understanding of JavaScript and React concepts. Specifically designed for those with limited experience in the development, creation, integration, and deployment of backend and full-stack systems, this book will equip you with the necessary skills to create high-quality web applications.
What you will learn
Implement a backend using Express and MongoDB, and unit-test it with Jest
Deploy full-stack web apps using Docker, set up CI/CD and end-to-end tests using Playwright
Add authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Create a GraphQL backend and integrate it with a frontend using Apollo Client
Build a chat app based on event-driven architecture using Socket.IO
Facilitate Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and implement server-side rendering
Use Next.js, an enterprise-ready full-stack framework, with React Server Components and Server Actions
