A **Go app** and a **Go/Gin app** differ primarily in their web framework approach and complexity:

## Standard Go App (net/http)

**Uses Go's built-in standard library:**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World")
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- Uses `net/http` package from standard library
- Manual route handling and middleware implementation
- More verbose code for common web tasks
- Full control over every aspect
- No external dependencies
- Suitable for simple applications or when you want minimal dependencies

## Go/Gin App

**Uses the Gin web framework:**
```go
package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "Hello World"})
    })
    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- External framework with additional features
- Built-in middleware (logging, recovery, CORS, etc.)
- Simplified routing and JSON handling
- Better performance than standard `net/http`
- More concise code for common web operations
- Built-in request binding and validation

## Key Differences

**Development Speed:**
- Gin: Faster development with built-in features
- Standard Go: More setup required for basic functionality

**Performance:**
- Gin: Optimized routing, faster than standard library
- Standard Go: Good performance but less optimized

**Learning Curve:**
- Standard Go: Requires understanding HTTP fundamentals
- Gin: Easier to get started, abstracts complexity

**Dependencies:**
- Standard Go: Zero external dependencies
- Gin: Adds external dependency but provides significant functionality

**Use Cases:**
- **Standard Go**: Microservices, learning HTTP concepts, minimal applications
- **Gin**: REST APIs, web applications, rapid prototyping, production web services

Your earlier code uses Gin, which explains the simpler routing syntax and built-in features like `gin.Default()` and static file serving. For most web applications, Gin provides a better developer experience while maintaining good performance.
