Assessment and Grading Policies:
How do you earn your grade?

Grading will be on a mix of the percentage of points available for class participation, assignments, quizzes and tests, team participation. In some cases, I will grade your noteking as part of the main grade or as extra credit grade. 

Grading will be on a mix of the percentage of points available for assignments and your attendance and participation in this class. See the Grade Table below for the grade point equivalents.

Quizzes -                10%

Mid Term Exam -         20%

Final Exam -                 20%

Assignments                30%

Attendance -                 10%

Extra Credit -                 1%

What are the rules about late work?

With the exception of the final project/assignment, projects/assignments are due at the start of class on the date indicated in the Class Schedule. Projects/assignments received late will be marked 50% off if the assignment is not submitted by the stated date on the calendar. After the second week, no late assignment will be accepted. The final project will not be accepted late. No assignments will be accepted after the last class meeting of the quarter.

No make-up tests or quizzes will be given unless prearranged. Prearranged is defined as: notifying the instructor of the inability to take the test or quiz before the scheduled time of the test or quiz.

You must make up the missed test or quiz within an agreed upon amount of time, no more than one week.

V grades and I Grades:
V - An instructor-initiated withdrawal of a student. The final grade issued if an instructor initiates a class withdrawal before the end of the quarter, often in consultation with the student, or if a student enrolls in a class but never attends or stops attending class. A faculty member is under no obligation to grant an instructor initiated withdrawal.

I - The incomplete is given at the discretion of the instructor only when the student has done satisfactory work but could not, for some unavoidable reason, complete some part of the coursework or take the final examination. The student and instructor prepare and sign an “Incomplete Grade Contract” (located in division offices) specifying the work to be completed. The contract will include the date by which all work must be submitted and the grade that will be submitted if the work is not completed. Incompletes given prior to Fall Quarter of 1990 will be assigned letter grades.

Course Policies: Academic Honesty:

I will not tolerate cheating. Grades on assignments, quizzes or tests will be adjusted as warranted. Students who are suspected to have cheated will have a private talk with me and/or the division director. During or after this discussion we may make a suitable adjustment, if circumstances seem to warrant it. The following list is a sample of items that I consider to be cheating, but is not a complete list:

Any assignment OR test which is copied in whole or in part from another person.
Plagiarism (please be sure that you know what this means).
Using corrected exams to study for late test taking.
Use of past test to study for test taking.
You are welcome to assist your classmates with your solution to the assignment, but NOT WITH YOUR CODE!!!
DO NOT SHARE YOUR CODE!!!! Share your solution, explanation, comments, etc
Attendance: Your “class participation” and your contributions are part of the grades. Generally there is a topic to be discussed each week of the course. The topics covered in this course can be difficult and require your attention and diligence. You should know that you should spend as many as 3 hours of additional time per hour of class time. 10% of your grade is based upon your participation within this course.

Last Meeting of Class
Last Instructional Day (LID) is Thursday March 13, 2025

Student Civility Code and Online Etiquette Expectations
I expect that students will conduct themselves in accordance with the Student Civility Code. The goal of the Student Civility Code is to improve the way Edmonds Community College educates students in the values of personal responsibility, consideration for others, and mutual respect in the presence of difference and disagreement. This means that everyone (students and faculty) should engage in courteous discourse - verbal and non-verbal, electronic and written. The primary way that communication will take place in our class is through internal canvas email, discussions and assignment feedback. I will always communicate with you in a respectful manner and my expectation is that you will communicate with me and your classmates in the same way.
