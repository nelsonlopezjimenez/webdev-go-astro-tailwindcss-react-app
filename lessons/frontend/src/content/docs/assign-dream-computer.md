## **STUDENT ASSIGNMENT SHEET**

### Welcome to Computer Building! üñ•Ô∏è

You're going to design your dream computer! Don't worry if these terms sound confusing - we'll explain everything step by step.

### **Your Mission**
Choose components to build a computer that's perfect for YOU. Think about:
- What will you use it for? (Gaming, school, work, videos?)
- How much would you want to spend?
- What features are most important to you?

---

## **COMPUTER COMPONENTS EXPLAINED**
*Everything you need to know to make smart choices*

### **1. PROCESSOR (CPU) - The Brain** üß†
**What it does:** Handles all the thinking and calculations
**Simple explanation:** Like your brain - faster CPUs can think through problems quicker

**Key Terms:**
- **Cores:** More cores = can do more tasks at once (like having multiple brains)
- **Speed (GHz):** Higher numbers = faster processing
- **Intel vs AMD:** Two major brands (like Coke vs Pepsi)

**Choose based on:**
- **Basic use** (web, email): Any processor works
- **Gaming**: Need fast processors 
- **Video editing**: Need lots of cores
- **Budget**: AMD often costs less

### **2. MEMORY (RAM) - Short-term Memory** üß†üíæ
**What it does:** Temporarily stores information the computer is currently using
**Simple explanation:** Like your desk space - more RAM = more projects open at once

**Key Terms:**
- **Size (GB):** 8GB = basic, 16GB = good, 32GB = lots
- **Speed (MHz):** Higher = faster, but less important than size
- **DDR4 vs DDR5:** DDR5 is newer and faster

**How much you need:**
- **4-8GB:** Basic web browsing, email
- **16GB:** Gaming, most tasks  
- **32GB:** Video editing, heavy multitasking

### **3. GRAPHICS CARD (GPU) - Visual Processor** üéÆüé®
**What it does:** Creates all the images you see on screen
**Simple explanation:** Like an artist - better GPUs create prettier, smoother pictures

**Key Terms:**
